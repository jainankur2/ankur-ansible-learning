# Install Apache on Web Servers

1. Install the httpd (Apache) package on your target web servers.
       Ensure the Apache service is started and enabled to start on boot.

2. Create a custom HTML page (index.html) that will be served by Apache.
       The content of the page should include:
        ```A welcome message: "Welcome to {{ ansible_fqdn }}!"
           The date and time when the page was generated: "Generated on {{ ansible_date_time.iso8601 }}"
           Use Ansible's template module to deploy the HTML page. The file should be a Jinja2 template (index.html.j2).```

3. Create Users: Create a user named deploy on each server.
       Ensure the deploy user is added to the sudo group.
       Set a password for the deploy user.

4. Handler: Restart Apache on Changes
       If any configuration file or package change requires Apache to be restarted, create a handler to restart the Apache service.

5. Vault-encrypted Variables
       Create a Vault-encrypted variable file for sensitive data like deploy user password.
       Decrypt and use these variables in the playbook.
